# MyTem - Item locator app

The idea behind MyTem is to create an app that enables the user to search for an item (in my testing I used mainly food & drinks), if the item is listed in the database
the app will list the stores that have said Item in store sorted by the distance to the user's current positon.

While the app works very good, getting access to all that information is of course difficult. It would require cooperation with every major & small store all around the 
world. For that reason, the app is not published in any app store.
Nevertheless, the app was a fun learning opportunity to engage more with Android development & Kotlin.

# Features
- Language agnostic. Currently, the app is available in English & German. Language is based on the device's language & culture settings
- Rapid search function that queries the underlying database
- Geolocation sorting. The app asks for permission to access the user's last known position & sorts stores based on that
- Search history to quickly find the last viewed items
- 2 different possibilities to view & select from the resulting stores
- Seamless integration with Google Maps. The user can view the stores on Google Maps inside the app & switch to the actual Google Maps application with the selected
  Store open, so the user can access all the additional informatio & services the Google Mapps app offers
- Shopping List prototype, the user is able to build shopping lists by selecting multiple items. The shopping list can be altered during & after creation.
  Shopping lists are stored on the user's device locally, so that they persist after the app is terminated.
  NOTE: This is a prototype, searching the list for store(s) is not possible yet.
